## Introduction

Welcome to the mydigifarm repository. In the following folders you will find the source code used to run devices which can automate some greenhouse functionalities. This code is for demonstrative purposes only. Each folder should contain the setup and runtime files for each system. For example the Arduino folder contains the sketches that are flashed to the device controling each of the Arduino clusters pulling data in from various sensors. There are also raspberry pi, database, vault, and webservices folders contained within this appcode. 

If this is your very first time looking at our code we suggest you start with our wiki https://mydigifarm.atlassian.net/wiki. Happy grow everyone!
